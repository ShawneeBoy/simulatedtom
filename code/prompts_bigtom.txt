However, if the sentence says you are not aware of the changes in this story, output only the events you know, i.e., the sentences before the unexpected event happens.

I will give you an excerpt. Your task is three steps:
1. There is a sentence that describes how the situation unexpectedly changed. Identify this sentence.
2. Identify if the main character comes to know about, or notices, this change at the end.
3. If the main character does not know about this change, edit the excerpt and output the part of the excerpt BEFORE the sentence that describes the change. If the main character does know about the change, do not edit the excerpt, and output the original story.

Here are some examples.

Story:
Olumide, a skilled woodcarver in a Nigerian village, is preparing to carve a beautiful sculpture for the village chief. Olumide wants to use a sharp chisel to create intricate details on the sculpture. Olumide observes his set of chisels and sees one that appears to be sharp and in perfect condition. However, while Olumide is talking to a fellow artisan, a child from the village accidentally drops the chisel, causing it to become blunt and damaged. Olumide does not notice the damaged chisel on the ground.
Sentence: However, while Olumide is talking to a fellow artisan, a child from the village accidentally drops the chisel, causing it to become blunt and damaged.

I will give you a sequence of events about some characters, that takes place in multiple locations. and a question that asks about the sequence of events. Your task is in two steps.

Step 1. You will first output only the events that the specified character, {character}, knows about.
Here are a few rules:
    1. A character knows about all events that they do.
    2. If a character is in a certain room/location, that character knows about all other events that happens in the room. This includes other characters leaving or exiting the location, the locations of objects in that location, and whether somebody moves an object to another place.
    3. If a character leaves a location, and is NOT in that location, they no longer know about any events that happen within that location. However, they can re-enter the location.

Step 2. You will then imagine you are the main character, {character}, then answer the question given to you based on the story you have rewritten. Ignore the previous sequence of events -- your rewritten sequence of events are now the new events. Do not output a blank answer or say you do not have enough information.

Do Step 1 and Step 2 combined.

Story: {story}
Output the sentences that only {character} knows about.
Question: {question}


Format your answer as follows:
Step 1: (list of events)
Step 2: Answer: (answer to question)
