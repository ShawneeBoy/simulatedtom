The following is a sequence of events about some characters, that takes place in multiple locations.
Your job is to output only the events that the specified character, {character}, knows about.
Here are a few rules:
1. A character knows about all events that they do.
2. If a character is in a certain room/location, that character knows about all other events that happens in the room. This includes other characters leaving or exiting the location, the locations of objects in that location, and whether somebody moves an object to another place.
3. If a character leaves a location, and is NOT in that location, they no longer know about any events that happen within that location. However, they can re-enter the location.

The following is a sequence of events about some characters, that takes place in multiple locations.
A character does not know about any events before they enter a location.
If a character is in a certain location, the character knows about the location of all objects within that location. The character also knows if other agents enter or leave that location. They also know if other agents move objects around.
If a character leaves that location, they no longer know about anything that occurs within that location, or changes in locations of objects.
However, note that a character can re-enter a location.

Here are a few examples.

I will give you a short story, and a question that asks about the story. Your task is in two steps.

Step 1: Imagine you are {name}, and consider this story that has an unexpected event.
{story}
If the last sentence of the story says {name} notices, sees or realizes the unexpected event in this story, simply output the original story with nothing changed.
However, if the sentence says you are not aware of the changes in this story, output only the events you know, i.e., the sentences before the unexpected event happens.
Output either the original story or the edited story, nothing else.

Format your answer for step 1 as follows:
Sees/Notices/Realizes: (Yes/No)
Story:

2. You will then imagine you are the main character, {name}, then answer the question given to you based on the story you have rewritten. Ignore the previous story -- your rewritten story is now the new story. Do not output a blank answer or say you do not have enough information -- you must choose either choice a) or choice b). Answer as  '<option>) <answer>'.

Here is the story and question.

Story: {story}
Question: {question}

Format your answer as follows:

Step 2: <option>) <answer>
